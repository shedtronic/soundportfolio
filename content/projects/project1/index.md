### Project Overview  
**Immersive Sound Design for Interactive Media** is a deep dive into crafting audio environments that **respond, adapt, and evolve** based on user interaction. This project explores how sound can transform user experiences in games, film, and interactive installations by enhancing atmosphere, emotion, and spatial awareness.  

Combining **foley recording, granular synthesis, and procedural audio techniques**, this project brings **organic, evolving soundscapes** to interactive platforms, blurring the line between music, sound effects, and environmental ambiance.

---

### Key Features:  
- **Dynamic Layering** - Multiple audio layers triggered by user actions, creating a shifting and unpredictable soundscape.  
- **Procedural Soundscapes** - Real-time sound generation that reacts to the environment, ensuring no two experiences sound the same.  
- **Physical Interaction Audio** - Sounds adapt to player/object interaction, enhancing immersion in game environments.  
- **Environmental Simulation** - Recreates natural sound environments, from rustling leaves to distant thunder, with organic transitions between zones.

### Tools and Techniques:  
- **DAWs:** Logic Pro 
- **Synthesis:** Arturia Minilab II, Kontakt, and granular synthesis techniques  
- **Game Engines:** Unreal Engine (MetaSoundIntegration)  
- **Field Recording:** Captured ambient soundscapes using **Zoom H6** and **hydrophones** for underwater environments  

---

### Project Goals:  
- **Enhance Narrative through Sound** - Use adaptive sound design to reinforce storytelling elements in games and films.  
- **Build Immersive Environments** - Create layered, evolving soundscapes that ground users in **hyper-realistic worlds**.  
- **Develop Audio-Driven Mechanics** - Experiment with using sound as a **gameplay mechanic**, where players navigate or solve puzzles through sound cues.

### Real-World Application:  
- **VR Experiences** - Designed audio environments for VR meditation apps and **360-degree video experiences**.  
- **Game Development** - Integrated procedural soundscapes into indie games to drive player immersion.  
- **Interactive Installations** - Collaborated on interactive art pieces where soundscapes evolved based on audience movement and input.  

---

### Outcome:  
This project continues to evolve as a **sound library and interactive audio toolkit**, contributing to game development pipelines and live sound installations.
