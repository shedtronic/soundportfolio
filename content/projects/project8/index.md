### Project Overview  

I have been inspired for a long time by different visual programming systems. I got the bug when I discovered Max-Msp years ago and tinkered with that for a while before moving to Processing and then P5.js. So when I found out about Touch Designer it was like the best of both worlds, something that had a node based interface with the programming and interfacing capabilities of something link Processing.
Its early days for me but as I am very interested in not only visuals and live projections for The Horses of the Gods, I am also looking at ways to integrate sound reactive visuals for performance. 
The project I am working on is to make reactive visuals to a soundtrack I have produced already but I think I can take this much further. 

The potential for creating live, reactive visuals that respond to sound in real-time is both exciting and a bit of a learning curve. The idea of using OSC or MIDI to bridge the two platforms opens up a lot of possibilities, not just for performance but also for installations and experimental projects.

To challenge myself, I'm planning to set up a system where visuals react dynamically to audio generated in Ableton Live and eventually Unreal Engine. This will involve mapping MIDI or audio analysis data to elements in TouchDesigner, creating a feedback loop where sound influences visuals and vice versa. I also want to experiment with generating ambient sounds directly within TouchDesigner, using audio CHOPs, and blending those with more complex audio from my DAW.

By combining generative audio with reactive visuals, I hope to create something that feels alive - something that embodies the hauntological and liminal themes I am currently exploring. This process will likely involve a lot of experimentation, but I'm looking forward to seeing where it leads and what unexpected connections emerge along the way.
