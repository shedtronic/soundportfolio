### Project Overview  
**Spatial Audio Environments** explores the intersection of sound, space, and interaction in virtual and augmented reality settings. This project aims to create immersive audio landscapes that react to user movement, delivering a rich, 360-degree auditory experience.  

By leveraging **binaural recording techniques, ambisonics, and dynamic sound placement**, this project pushes the boundaries of how audio can drive immersion in virtual worlds.

---

### Key Features:  
- **3D Audio Design** â€“ Sound is rendered in full 360 degrees, responding to head tracking and environmental shifts.  
- **Ambisonic Encoding** â€“ Uses ambisonic audio to provide a sense of height, depth, and width, placing users at the center of a responsive soundscape.  
- **Interactive Audio Triggers** â€“ Sound objects change based on user proximity, creating evolving soundscapes that respond to interaction.  
- **Applications in VR** â€“ Designed for VR platforms like **Oculus Quest 2 and Vive**, bringing audio to the forefront of immersive storytelling.

### Tools and Techniques:  
- **DAWs:** Logic Pro, Ableton Live  
- **Spatial Audio Software:** Reaper (Ambisonic Toolkit), Dolby Atmos Renderer  
- **Engines:** Unity (Spatializer Plugin), Unreal Engine (MetaSound)  
- **Hardware:** Binaural microphones, field recorders, and VR headset tracking systems  

---

### Project Goals:  
- To develop **responsive audio landscapes** for VR storytelling and virtual exhibitions.  
- Enhance **emotional engagement** by crafting soundscapes that evolve alongside user interaction.  
- Experiment with **acoustic ecology concepts** to replicate natural environments and create abstract audio-driven worlds.
