### Project Overview  


This project explores the use of Sonic Pi as a tool for creating generative soundscapes and live-coded music. Sonic Pi offers a unique opportunity to combine coding with sound design, allowing me to build dynamic audio environments that can evolve in real-time. My goal is to develop a series of experiments using Sonic Pi to create ambient and rhythmic compositions, ultimately leading to live performance opportunities or integration with other interactive media projects.



Goals and Objectives

The main objective of this project is to harness Sonic Pi's capabilities for:
	-	Generative music creation, where patterns and sequences are generated algorithmically.
	-	Live coding performance, experimenting with how sound can be manipulated on the fly.
	-	Integration with external hardware such as MIDI controllers or modular synths.

A key focus is on creating soundscapes that explore the themes of hauntology, liminality, and the eerie concepts that align with my broader sound design practice.



The Setup: Tools and Techniques

I am using:
	-	Sonic Pi software, running on a Mac with a MIDI keyboard for real-time input.
	-	Code-based sequencing to generate evolving patterns and textures.
	-	Synth and sample manipulation within Sonic Pi, blending organic and synthetic sounds.

The initial experiments involve building simple loops and patterns, then gradually introducing randomization and conditional logic to create a sense of unpredictability.



Generative Sound Design Approach

Initial Experiments

My first experiments focus on:
	-	Algorithmic rhythms, using random seeds to vary percussion sequences.
	-	Evolving melodies, with generative note selection based on predefined scales.
	-	Ambient textures, using reverb and delay to create a sense of space and depth.



Taking It Further: Integration and Performance

The next phase involves:
	-	Connecting Sonic Pi to external hardware, such as a MIDI controller for live manipulation of parameters.
	-	Exploring OSC (Open Sound Control) integration, potentially linking Sonic Pi to visual applications like  TouchDesigner or OsciRender.
	-	Building sound-driven visuals, using Sonic Pi as an audio source for reactive animation.

A key experiment will be to create a live-coded performance where visuals and audio are tightly synchronized, allowing audiences to experience a fully immersive and dynamic show.



Thematic Exploration

This project also offers a chance to explore how generative sound can convey specific themes:
	-	Hauntological elements, using delay and echo to create ghostly repetitions.
	-	Urban Wyrd vibes, by layering field recordings with synthesized drones.
	-	Exploring liminal spaces, using generative audio to represent places that exist on the edge of the known and the unknown.

By experimenting with how different parameters affect the sound output, I aim to develop a workflow that allows for spontaneous yet controlled musical expression.



Next Steps

In the coming weeks, I will:
	1.	Refine my Sonic Pi codebase, building a library of reusable functions and patterns.
	2.	Test integration with external visuals, exploring how sound can drive animations.
	3.	Record a series of short audio experiments, possibly releasing them as a mini album or sound pack.

I will document this process through blog posts and audio clips, sharing insights into how coding can be used as a creative tool for sound design.

Ultimately, this project is about pushing the boundaries of generative audio, exploring how coding can bring new life to sound design and performance.
