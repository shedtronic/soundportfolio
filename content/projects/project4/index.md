We Wish You Health is the first album by The Horses of the Gods, is an album that I feel embodies an ethos of resourceful production. We took a long time to record this almost entirely acoustic album, and we crafted it with minimal equipment and fit it together narratively like a puzzle. It was mixed and mastered entirely on an old laptop. We think that that we achieved a sonic depth that has resonated with listeners. The album captures the raw, sparse and organic essence of The Horses of the Gods, blending traditional elements with an atmospheric, almost hauntologically-infused eerie sound steeped in folklore.

Our most popular track, John Barleycorn, is steadily growing in reach across streaming platforms and finding an engaged audience.  We think its a testament to the effectiveness of the subtlety of the mixing and mastering process. Despite working with a pared-down setup, the focus on clarity, balance, and dynamic warmth ensured the final mix sounded rich and immersive.

This project was not only an exercise in DIY audio engineering but also a lesson in how the limitations of technology can shape a distinctive aesthetic. The final master was optimized for Spotify, Apple Music, and Bandcamp, ensuring that the album translated well across streaming platforms while maintaining its organic character.

The production and release of We Wish You Health is an example of how thoughtful mixing and mastering regardless of equipment can elevate a recording, proving that great sound is as much about technique and vision as it is about equipment. I definitely learned a lot about both mixing and mastering, and having since taken a short course in mastering realise how much I can do to improve the next album which is already in the early stages of recording.
