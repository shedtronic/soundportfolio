Sow In was an early demo when putting together We Wish You Health. There is an early demo which was just me on an acoustic guitar but the first recording of this song was created at a village hall near Bath and essentially this track was build around that original recording. The atmosphere of the location was captured in this recording, as it was between two neolithic burial mounds, and on the edge of the area where the civil war battle of Lansdown took place. We have a tendency to pick remote or eerie locations for recording. 
It started as a simple zoom H4n recording in one take but the disadvantage was that the guitar and vocals were on the same track. We added an extra track of guitar at the time, but then set to a series of overdubs in the DAW to try to keep the village hall feel to it. I particularly like that there are some background atmos in this recording which you might hear such as a milkbottle top falling of the kitchen work top and some other faint atmos sounds in the background.
The vocal harmonies and violin add a subtle accompaniment were added much later. The hardest thing to create here was the intimacy and the slow pace of the original demo whilst trying to make it sound more expansive and almost like a theme tune to some archived TV programme.
