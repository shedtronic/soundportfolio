During the first lockdown, we collaborated with Fable Feast, a London-based immersive theatre company, to bring the poem Hatton’s Cross by Jim Jack to life. Working alongside actor Benjamin Peter Jones and a team of animators, we created a haunting animated piece.

The quiet streets of the lockdown era provided a unique backdrop for our field recordings, amplifying the sounds of nature that are often masked by constant traffic noise. This absence of urban noise pollution inspired us to explore how sound shapes our relationship with the environment. Armed with field recordings captured during eerie woodland explorations, we assembled layers of atmospheric audio in our DAW, experimenting with chilling sound effects to craft a spine-tingling soundscape.

The final production, Hatton’s Cross, is available on Fable Feast’s YouTube channel. For the full experience, dim the lights, turn up the volume, and immerse yourself in the eerie world we helped create.
