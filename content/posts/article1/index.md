## Introduction
As part of my research into immersion within a 360 audio environment, I have been exploring FMOD within Unity but more recently weighing up whether to invest time into FMOD within Unreal. In more recent updates Unreal Engine 5 now has its own dedicated interactive sound engine, MetaSounds. I am currently exploring ways to incorporate this into a personal project. I am in the process of building a working demonstration of techniques. In the lead up to this point, I am going to test a range of applications of MetaSound Blueprints and explore some field recording techniques to capture the sounds I need.
