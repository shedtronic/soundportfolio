Over the last couple of weeks, I've been developing **Unstable Memory**, an experimental audiovisual project built using **p5.js**, designed to run fullscreen in kiosk mode. Here's a quick development timeline, code highlights, and reflections so far.

## ðŸ§  Project Goals

- Create a glitchy, nostalgic sound-reactive visual experience.
- Allow users to interact via mouse and sliders.
- Package it as a **browser-based kiosk** for installations.

### âœ… Day 1: Project Setup
- Initialized HTML and JavaScript structure.
- Added `p5.js` and `p5.sound` libraries via CDN.
- Set up the canvas and fullscreen rendering.
