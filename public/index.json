This project aims to create immersive audio landscapes that react to user movement, delivering a rich, 360-degree auditory experience.\nBy leveraging binaural recording techniques, ambisonics, and dynamic sound placement, this project pushes the boundaries of how audio can drive immersion in virtual worlds.\nKey Features: # 3D Audio Design â€“ Sound is rendered in full 360 degrees, responding to head tracking and environmental shifts. Ambisonic Encoding â€“ Uses ambisonic audio to provide a sense of height, depth, and width, placing users at the center of a responsive soundscape. Interactive Audio Triggers â€“ Sound objects change based on user proximity, creating evolving soundscapes that respond to interaction. Applications in VR â€“ Designed for VR platforms like Oculus Quest 2 and Vive, bringing audio to the forefront of immersive storytelling. Tools and Techniques: # DAWs: Logic Pro, Ableton Live Spatial Audio Software: Reaper (Ambisonic Toolkit), Dolby Atmos Renderer Engines: Unity (Spatializer Plugin), Unreal Engine (MetaSound) Hardware: Binaural microphones, field recorders, and VR headset tracking systems Project Goals: # To develop responsive audio landscapes for VR storytelling and virtual exhibitions. Enhance emotional engagement by crafting soundscapes that evolve alongside user interaction. Experiment with acoustic ecology concepts to replicate natural environments and create abstract audio-driven worlds.

This project explores how light interacts with sound waves, generating unique and dynamic tones.\nFeatures: # Classic Atari Punk Console Circuit: Based on the 555 timer IC. Light Modulation: Using photoresistors to alter sound frequencies in real time. Interactive Controls: Adjustable knobs and light sources for custom soundscapes. Video Demo: # Build Instructions: # Gather Components: 556 timer IC Photoresistors Potentiometers Capacitors and resistors Speaker or audio output Assemble the Circuit: Follow the classic Atari Punk Console schematic and integrate the light modulation section. Test and Modify: Experiment with different light sources and adjust the controls to explore various sound possibilities. Applications: # This project is perfect for:\nBeginners in electronics and sound design. Exploring sound modulation with environmental inputs. Creating unique soundscapes for artistic or musical projects.
