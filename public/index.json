By connecting three potentiometers on a breadboard, I tested sound generation capabilities and laid the groundwork for portable synthesis modules. This experiment aims to merge environmental sensory input with generative sound synthesis, drawing inspiration from the layers of natural, mechanical, and hidden information present in our surroundings.\nContent:\nIn this experiment, I set up an Arduino Uno for synthesis development using a combination of stock components and found materials. My goal was to test the basic sound generation capabilities of the system and establish a foundation for future development.\nThe Setup\nUsing a breadboard, I connected three potentiometers to the Arduino. Each potentiometer served as a control for different aspects of sound generation, allowing for real-time manipulation. This basic setup demonstrated that the Arduino Uno could produce responsive audio signals with minimal hardware.\nNext Steps with the Mozzi Library\nWith this initial test complete, I\u0026rsquo;m delving deeper into the Mozzi library, a powerful tool for audio synthesis on microcontrollers. The library will allow for more complex sound design, enabling the creation of portable synthesis modules that can react to various stimuli.\nExploring Generative Soundscapes\nOne of my key interests is to explore how the built environment, with its layers of natural and mechanical sounds, can influence generative audio synthesis. By incorporating sensors to capture auditory, visual, and hidden data from the environment, I aim to create a sound-sensing module. This module will not only respond to ambient stimuli but also allow for intentional manipulation, resulting in unique generative soundscapes.\nThis experiment is the beginning of a journey into portable, adaptive synthesis. I look forward to sharing updates as I refine these ideas and integrate more sensory elements into the design.\n","date":"14 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/article6/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Arduino Mozzi Synth Progress","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/mozzi/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mozzi","type":"tags"},{"content":" Introduction # ","date":"14 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/article3/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"OsciRender Sound Design with Blender","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/synth/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Synth","type":"tags"},{"content":"As part of my research into immersion within a 360 audio environment, I have been exploring FMOD within Unity but more recently weighing up whether to invest time into FMOD within Unreal.

I am interested in ways to manipulate visuals using oscilloscope art using a program called OsciRender and sound. I eventually want to experiment with interactions using OsciRender, OSC protocol to allow ways to send sound from the DAW to Osci Render to allow audiences to participate with visuals but that will be explored once I have the connections I need. So I am going to begin with just manipulating OsciRender with Blender as they have good integration and you can bring in 3D animation into the artwork, but later I want to hook up Touch Designer to to this project to allow for more creative control, allowing introduction of glitch visuals and sound through OSC from Logic or Ableton.\nOscilloscope art has a distinct aesthetic that blends retro-futurism, glitch aesthetics, and scientific visualisation. The idea of using sound as a direct manipulator of shape and motion is fascinating - sound literally becoming the visual element.\nPhase 1: Exploring OsciRender in Blender\nTo start, I will focus on manipulating OsciRender within Blender, since the two integrate well. Blender\u0026rsquo;s animation and shading systems allow for 3D movement and distortions, adding another dimension to the traditionally 2D oscilloscope visuals. This phase will focus on: .\tLearning OsciRender\u0026rsquo;s waveform rendering techniques .\tCreating simple animated shapes using Blender\u0026rsquo;s modifiers .\tExperimenting with sound-generated waveforms to drive movement\nPhase 2: Expanding to TouchDesigner and OSC\nOnce I have a solid foundation in OsciRender and Blender, I will begin experimenting with TouchDesigner, an environment that excels at real-time visual manipulation. The goal is to integrate OSC (Open Sound Control) into the workflow, allowing dynamic interaction between sound and visuals in real time. Potential avenues for exploration include: .\tUsing OSC to send data from a DAW (Logic Pro/Ableton) to TouchDesigner .\tIntroducing glitch aesthetics and generative visual distortions .\tDeveloping interactive elements where an audience can influence the visuals through sound\n","date":"31 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/project6/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Oscilloscope Harmonics: Sound Design through Blender and OSC","type":"projects"},{"content":" Project Overview # Spatial Audio Environments explores the intersection of sound, space, and interaction in virtual and augmented reality settings.

By integrating light-dependent resistors (LDRs) into the classic APC design, this experiment investigates how light variations can influence sound synthesis. The project combines DIY electronics with creative sound design, showcasing the potential for interactive, light-driven sonic outputs.\nBackground The Atari Punk Console is a classic DIY sound synthesis circuit known for its raw, lo-fi sound. Based on the 556 dual-timer IC, it produces square wave tones with a characteristic retro, arcade-like aesthetic. By modifying the standard APC design to include light-sensitive components, the project aims to add a layer of environmental interactivity to the synthesis process.\nKey Features of the Project 1.\tLight Sensitivity .\tLight-Dependent Resistors (LDRs): Two LDRs are wired into the circuit to modulate the oscillators based on ambient light levels. .\tReal-Time Interaction: Changes in light intensity directly influence pitch and tone, creating a dynamic and interactive sound experience. 2.\tCircuit Design .\tCore Components: A 556 dual-timer IC forms the backbone of the APC, with potentiometers controlling key parameters like pitch and tone. .\tModifications: LDRs replace or supplement standard potentiometer controls, allowing for light-reactive modulation. 3.\tSound Output .\tProduces noisy, glitchy, and tonal variations influenced by light input. .\tOutput can be fed into additional effects or amplified for standalone use.\nChallenges and Insights Calibration involved adjusting the LDR sensitivity to achieve a desirable range of pitch modulation. Testing in various lighting conditions emphasized the need to design for both controlled and uncontrolled environments.\nApplications and Future Plans The APC light oscillator could serve as an expressive instrument for live performances, reacting to stage lighting or handheld torches. It has potential as a tool for generative soundscapes when combined with other modular synth elements. The projectâ€™s straightforward design also makes it suitable for teaching basic electronics and sound synthesis concepts.\nMaterials Used .\t556 Timer IC .\tLight-Dependent Resistors (LDRs) .\tPotentiometers (for additional manual control) .\tCapacitors and Resistors .\tBreadboard and Jumper Wires .\tPower Source: 9V battery or equivalent\nProgress So Far This project has successfully integrated LDRs into the APC design, demonstrating the potential for light-responsive sound synthesis. The results are promising, with rich sonic textures emerging from light interactions. Next steps include creating a portable enclosure, experimenting with LED feedback loops for added visual elements, and integrating the APC with other modular or DIY synth projects for expanded functionality.\nThis project is a step toward blending retro-inspired sound synthesis with modern, interactive technologies. It represents a fusion of nostalgia, experimentation, and creative expression, aligning with the broader goals of my sound design practice.\n","date":"31 May 2017","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/project5/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"The Atari Punk Console/Light Oscillator","type":"projects"},{"content":" Koochie - Regicide - The Ruler EP # undesignuk Â· Regicide - Koochie - Written by Mike Ballard 1995 ","date":"3 June 1995","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/music2/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Koochie - Regicide","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"3 June 1995","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/pop/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pop","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"3 June 1995","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/punk/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Punk","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
