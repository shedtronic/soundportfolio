# Unstable Memory 0.1

**Unstable Memory 0.1** is an experimental browser-based audiovisual work exploring themes of media decay, glitch aesthetics, hauntology, and interaction. Built using `p5.js` and `Web Audio API`, this interactive piece lets users manipulate sound and image in real time using mouse-based input, glitch parameters, and sample control.

## 🌀 Concept

This prototype simulates the effect of a malfunctioning audiovisual memory system — where overlapping loops, corrupted media, and unstable input converge into something emergent. It encourages the audience to explore noise, failure, and resonance, echoing themes of:
- Forgotten media formats (VHS, tape, early digital)
- Ghosts of culture embedded in sound
- Interference as a metaphor for distortion of memory

## ✅ Current Features

- 🎛 **Mouse-Controlled Pitch, Volume, and Glitch**
  - X-axis = pitch/speed
  - Y-axis = volume and glitch intensity
  - Works only on mouse click/drag to avoid accidental changes

- 🌈 **Reactive Visual System**
  - Glitch art inspired visuals generated on canvas
  - Color/saturation changes based on input
  - RGB split + blur for VHS-style distortion

- 🎚 **UI Panel (Right)**
  - **Reverb** (0–100%)
  - **Filter Sweep** (Low → High)
  - **Balance** (Crossfades Sample A to B in stereo field)
  - **Sample A / B Selectors** (choose from local audio files)
  - **Crackle & Pop** (adds vinyl/cassette style noise)
  - **Glitch Toggle** (disable/enable datamosh)

- 🔊 **Dual Sample Playback**
  - Sample A and Sample B looped continuously
  - Cross-modulated using UI and mouse
  - Custom error handling for broken/missing files

- 📈 **Stereo Output Meter**
  - L / R channel bars react to each sample respectively

- ⚠️ **Start Audio & Epilepsy Warning**
  - Displays glitch-styled message before engagement
  - Audio context only starts after click

## 🧭 Development Roadmap

Planned for future versions post focus-group testing:

### 🎧 Audio Features
- Granular synthesis engine
- Reverse playback toggle
- Tape warble modulation
- Additional reverb types and spatialization
- Export current session as WAV (if feasible)

### 👁 Visuals & Media
- Lo-fi VHS video overlays (silent looping textures)
- Fragmented video scenes triggered by glitch peaks
- Visual presets or "moods" users can cycle through
- Ghost iconography or haunted sprites
- Blackout blocks / datamosh chunk artifacts

### 🧪 Interaction & Input
- Multi-touch support (mobile version)
- Preset scene selector (different FX/audio states)
- MIDI controller compatibility (knobs = sliders)
- WebSocket or OSC input for live performance version

### 🧱 Infrastructure / Deployment
- Netlify-hosted version with access fallback
- Raspberry Pi kiosk mode auto-boot
- Save last session state using `localStorage`
- QR code overlay linking to full sound portfolio
